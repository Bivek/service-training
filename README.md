The training material for the service repo broken out into steps.

Reviewing the differences between the successive steps helps to reinforce the
ideas each change is about. You can do this by running the following command
against two directories like `dirdiff 01-startup 02-shutdown`
```
alias dirdiff='git diff -p --stat --no-index'
```
